Hey! Welcome to Ember Ghost, it's great to have you :)

We know that first impressions are important, so we've populated your new site with some initial **Getting Started** posts that will help you get familiar with everything in no time. This is the first one!


### There are a few things that you should know up-front:

1. Ember Ghost is designed to be a static site version of the amazing [Ghost blogging platform](https://ghost.org/)

1. Ember Ghost is designed for developers who know how to deploy a satic site (folder of html files and assets) using something like S3 or even just on NGINX.

1. If you are slightly less tech savvy or if you want to manage your blog outside of just a set of files in a git repo we highly recommend signing up for [Ghost](https://ghost.org/pricing/)

The main thing you'll want to read about next is probably: [the Ghost editor](/the-editor/).

Once you're done reading, you can simply delete the default **Ghost** user from your team to remove all of these introductory posts!
